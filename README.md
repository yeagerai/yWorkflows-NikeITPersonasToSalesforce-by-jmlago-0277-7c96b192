# NikeITPersonasToSalesforce

This Yeager Workflow collects information about employees from Nike (company) in the IT department, including their names and email addresses, and sends the gathered data to Salesforce. The entire process consists of four steps: 1) Collection of data from a predefined data source/API specific to Nike's IT department employees. 2) Data extraction and parsing according to the required format (name and email). 3) Data validation to ensure correctness and integrity. 4) Sending the collected and validated data to Salesforce, utilizing the Salesforce API to either create or update contact records.
